# AI-Learning
My step-by-step AI Engineer learning journey
Day 2 complete — practiced conditionals and logic flow.
Day 3 – learned how to loop through data and compute summaries.
Day 4 – learned strings & dictionaries, useful for labeling data and configs in AI models.
Day 5 – learned NumPy arrays and matrix operations; first step toward GPU computing.
Day 6 – Vector recap practice
Day 7 – Linear regression in NumPy; implemented best-fit line and error computation.
Day 8 – Implemented gradient descent from scratch; tuned learning rate; loss decreased successfully.
Day 9 – Vectorized Gradient Descent & LR Exploration
Day 11 – First NN in PyTorch
Day 12 - Build the models(Logistic Regression and Two Layer Net)
Week3 Deep Learning Foundations
Day 13 - familiar with the equations that are used in Deep Learning
Day 14 - build a TinyCNN model
